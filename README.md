# web_based
This is a static page, which showcases the css and html skills I have gainind in the duration of my studies.
It was for an assignment, where we were given the desktop layout for the pages and we had to recreate them from scratch. It was also required to make the layout responsive for different screen sizes. The responsive layout was for us to design (link to the page https://aspa7beginner.github.io/web_based/).  

The first page is a sample page of an online store, for a selected product. All links are simbolic. There
is another page that contains a form for new user registration. The second page is also static, there is no
server side programming. In order for the user to navigate to the form page, they have to follow the 
"Create account" link on the main menu baner.

A docker container link with the php code that handles the form's inputs is in progress and will be provided at a later time.

Main characteristics:
  Placing and organizing the page elements, mainly by using grid layout.
  Making the site responsive for different screen sizes, including mobile phones.
