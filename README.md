# web_based
This is a static page, which showcases the css and html skills I have gainind in the duration of my studies.

The first page is a sample page of an online store, for a selected product. All the links are simbolic. There
is another page where a form for a new user registration is displayed. The second page is also static, there is
server side programming. In order for the user to navigate to the page with the form, they have to follow the 
"Create account" link on the main menu.


A docker container link with the php code that handles the form's inputs, will be provided provided at later 
stage.

Main characteristics:
  Placing and organizing the page elements, mainly by using grid layout.
  Making the site responsive for different screen sizes, including mobile phones.
